Fourth Project for Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course 2020 on edX by HarvardX.

The Back-end was given by the course staff, and I was asked to use JavaScript on the front-end to achieve the following tasks:
- Send email through the use of fetch
- Load the requested mailbox's emails (inbox, sent or archived) for the user
- Ability to click on each email to read its contents in its own view
- Archive and unarchive emails
- Reply emails

On this projects I showcased the use of JavaScript to accomplish tasks on the front.
