# mail
Fourth Project for Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course 2020 on edX by HarvardX.

This project is a single-page email application in which users can create their own email, send mail, and view different mailboxes. 

The Back-end was given by the course staff, and I was asked to use JavaScript on the front-end to achieve the following tasks:
- Send emails to users through the use of fetch.
- Load the requested mailbox's emails (among inbox, sent or archived) for the user.
- Ability to click on each individual email to read its contents on a separated view.
- Archive and unarchive emails.
- Reply emails

In this projects I showcased the use of JavaScript to design single-page applications on the front- end (DOM manipulation, API calls, array and string methods, etc.).

The file where all these tasks were implemented is located on mail/static/mail/inbox.js.
